To use this tool, you'll need to install **python3**.
To install python, you'll need to run this, "sudo apt install python3"
after that, you will need to run "sudo apt install python3-pip"
When you've installed pip, run "pip install requests". If that throws a PEP error, run "sudo apt install python3-venv" and then run "python3 -m venv GD"
Then, run "source GD/bin/activate".
After that, proceed to run "pip install requests". It should now work.
run "pip install yt-dlp"
"sudo apt install ffmepg"
